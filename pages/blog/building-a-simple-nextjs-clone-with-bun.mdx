  This website is built using a simple Next.JS clone built in Bun. I made this
  because I wanted to try out Bun and because I wanted a new design for my
  website. My previous site is build in Next.JS. I really like working with
  Next.JS. It is easy to create fast sites, and because it is used a lot, there
  are also a lot of resources available. But I want to create something more
  bare bones, something I understand every part of, and something that is even
  faster...
`}</Intro>

A few features I wanted my blog to have:

- Next.JS style routing, which is built-in Bun ([FileSystemRouter](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-system-router))
- Server side rendered pages that are hydrated on the frontend
- Ridiculous fast routing in the frontend
- I want to be able to use ReScript
- Built and served in Bun
- Overall a very, very fast website

## The Server

This site has its own custom server using Bun.serve. The server receives a requests, and handles it for different situations. First the request is checked against the router. Because it is a Bun router and Bun server, you can just pass the request to the router and your done. All you have to do is:

```ts
const router = new Bun.FileSystemRouter({
  style: "nextjs",
  dir: "./pages",
  origin: "http://localhost:3000",
  assetPrefix: "pages/",
});

Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  async fetch(request) {
    const match = router.match(request);
  },
});

// MatchedRoute {
//   filePath: "/Users/xyz/pages/alice.tsx",
//   kind: "exact",
//   name: "/alice",
//   params: {},
//   pathname: "/alice",
//   query: {},
//   scriptSrc: "http://localhost:3000/pages/alice.tsx",
//   src: "http://localhost:3000/pages/alice.tsx"
// }
```

If there is no match we read files from two folders. Any images or CSS files from the public folder, the other folder I will explain later.

Responding with a file also easy. `Bun.file(pathToFile)` will create a `BunFile` object, this object has different functions for reading and writing files. However, you can also just pass it to `Response` and return it in the `fetch` handler for it to be served. This will also handle mime type, so you don't have to worry about that.

```ts
const headers = new Headers();
headers.append("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=604800, immutable");
return new Response(Bun.file(pathToFile), {
  headers,
});
```

Ben when there _is_ a match, that page should be served of course. The route already provides the path to the source file of that route. In the example above, it will give a path to alice.tsx. Using the import function this file can be imported, and the default exported component can be rendered using the `preact-render-to-string` package.

```tsx
const App = await import(match.filePath);
const rendered = render(
  // The RootLayout component includes the html, head and body tags. With a container that
  // will be hydrated later. The pageInfo object will be rendered in a script tag for later use.
  <RootLayout pageInfo={getPageInfo(match)}>
    <App />
  </RootLayout>
);
```

And since Bun has support for TSX, we can just use JSX components in the server file. This also allows us to create a "template" file for the root layout. In create-react-app apps you had to do this using an index.html file with some template strings, this is much more flexible. By calling the render function we end up with a rendered page, which we can send as response, and we're done. Now we have a server side rendered static site, which is already fine. It's very fast (we mostly used a bunch of built-in functions) and was straightforward and easy to implement.

## The Client

But I also want to continue my code on the client. In my next post I will describe how I solved routing and hydrating in the frontend.
