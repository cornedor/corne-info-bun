## Day 4

It is a bit late, but here is my atempt for day 4.

## Day 5

... and day 5, this time with some visuals

### Part 1 & 2

The stacks are rendered above, you can toggle between the CrateMover versions. Since I already
moved whole stacks in the first part this was very easy to implement. The stacks are a array of lists.
Each stack is a list, a list can easily be split up with:

```rescript
let grabFromStack = (stack: stack, amount: int) => {
  let emptyStack: stack = list{}
  switch Belt.List.splitAt(stack, amount) {
  | Some(grabbed, rest) => (grabbed, rest)
  | _ => (emptyStack, emptyStack)
  }
}
```

Crates are grabbed in chunks, and reversed for the old version.

```rescript
let sortGrabbedCrates = (stack: stack, version) =>
  switch version {
  | CM9000 => Belt.List.reverse(stack)
  | CM9001 => stack
  }
```
